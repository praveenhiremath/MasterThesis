This ADP2 is slightly improved version of the one developed in Master's thesis (ADP1). The ADP2 is fitted to elastic constants and surface energies of (100), (110), (111) and (112) in addition to the E(V) curves which formed the fitting database of ADP1. The configurations in the database are evaluated using ELK FP-LAPW DFT calulations.  

This is my Master's thesis work and not a peer-reviewed publication at any journal. You are welcomed to use build up on/improve this potential for your specific needs.
